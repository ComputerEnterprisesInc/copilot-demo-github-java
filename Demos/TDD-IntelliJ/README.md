# Test Driven Development (TDD) with Java through IntelliJ

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software develpment proces relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. Since unit testing or any type of functional or performance testings are very important in Java development, TDD practice is very highly encouraged among Java developers. Copilot is a great tool to help Java developers to write unit tests for their Java code as it can helps to bootstrap a lot of repetitive code for unit tests.

As you can see in the picture below, TDD process involves writing tests first, see if it fails (goes to red), then write code to make the test pass (green). Copilot can help you to write the test code and you can focus on writing the code to make the test pass.

This demo is focusing around how to use Copilot to easily write unit tests for Java code. We will be using IntelliJ IDEA for this demo.

## Prerequisites

- [Installed IntellI IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [GitHub Copilot Extension for IntellJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Download a sample project codes called TDDJava](./TDDJava)

[See this documentation on how to install Copilot extension for IntelliJ](/CopilotExtnsion4IntelliJ)

## Steps

Welcome! In this starting Copilot demo for **Test Driven Development (TDD) using IntelliJ**, you will start with a sample **Java + Maven** projects that contain some starting codes that can help you to implement TDD using Copilot.
